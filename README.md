# 🚦 Smart Traffic Control System (Using Distributed Sensors)

A **mini web simulation** of a smart traffic management system that uses **distributed sensors** to optimize traffic light control based on real-time (simulated) vehicle data.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simplified version of a **Smart Traffic Control System**, where:
- Multiple intersections collect **sensor data** (vehicle counts).
- A **smart algorithm** dynamically controls which intersection gets a green light based on congestion.
- Traffic lights update in **real time** using **JavaScript simulation**.

It is a front-end only demo built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Real-time simulation of distributed vehicle sensors  
✅ Dynamic traffic light control logic  
✅ Start/Stop simulation controls  
✅ Responsive and visually clean dashboard  
✅ 100% client-side – no backend required

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sensor Simulation**  
   - Random vehicle counts are generated at each intersection every few seconds.

2. **Smart Control Algorithm**  
   - The system compares vehicle counts at each intersection.  
   - The intersection with more vehicles gets the **green light**, while others get **red**.

3. **Real-Time Updates**  
   - Lights and sensor readings update dynamically in the browser.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart-traffic-control.git
Navigate to the folder:

bash
Copy code
cd smart-traffic-control
Open index.html in your browser.

That’s it — no setup required!

🧭 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add real IoT sensor integration using APIs
🔹 Introduce more intersections and adaptive AI logic
🔹 Visualize traffic flow with animations
🔹 Add backend (Node.js + WebSocket) for real-time data streaming
